## Project Description

The **Loyalty App** project consists of a Mobile App and a Control Panel. The concept was developed in collaboration with the client, aiming to create an application where customers could accumulate points when making purchases at physical stores. Customers would show a QR code generated by the app, which the store administrator would scan to add the corresponding points. Additionally, the app features a news feed and promotions.

## Functionality

### Control Panel for Administrators:
- **Add or Remove Points**: Manage customer loyalty points.
- **Redeem Rewards**: Handle the process of customers exchanging points for rewards.
- **Post News**: Update the news feed with new information.
- **Configure Instagram Integration**: Manage Instagram settings for automatic news updates.

### Mobile App for Customers:
- **View News Feed**: Stay updated with the latest news.
- **View Offers**: Access special offers.
- **View Promotions**: Check out ongoing promotions.
- **View Credit History**: Track the history of credit transactions.

## Challenges

This project presented various challenges, such as developing the application for iOS. Additionally, integrating the Instagram API for automatic news updates required meticulous configuration and testing.

## Conclusion

The **Loyalty App** is a comprehensive solution for enhancing customer engagement and loyalty through a seamless point accumulation system and up-to-date news and promotions. This project highlights the ability to integrate various technologies to create a user-friendly and efficient platform for both customers and administrators, significantly improving the overall customer experience and business operations.
