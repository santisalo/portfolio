## Project Description

**App Delivery Restaurant** is a project that consists of a **Control Panel** for administrators and a **Mobile Application** for customers. Through the mobile application, customers can place orders that restaurants receive and prepare for pickup. Once the restaurant confirms the receipt of the order, a notification is sent to the customer. Additionally, when the order is on its way, another notification is sent to keep the customer informed.

## Functionality

### Control Panel for Administrators
Through the control panel, restaurant administrators can:

- **Manage categories**: Create, edit, and delete categories.
- **Manage products**: Create, edit, and delete products.
- **Configure product variants and extras**: Create, edit, and delete product variants and extras.
- **Administer offers**: Create, edit, and delete offers.
- **Set operating hours**: Establish and adjust operating hours.
- **Manage orders**: Handle and update the status of orders.
- **Generate reports**: Analyze restaurant performance and statistics.

### Mobile Application for Customers
Through the mobile application, customers can:

- **Place and manage orders**: Select products, variants, and extras, and place orders.
- **Receive notifications**: Get notified about changes in the status of their orders.
- **View available offers**: Access current promotions and offers.

## Challenges

The development of **App Delivery Restaurant** presented several significant challenges:

- **Integration of real-time notifications**: Implementing an efficient system to keep customers informed about the status of their orders.
- **System scalability**: Designing an architecture capable of handling a large volume of users and simultaneous orders.
- **Intuitive user interface**: Creating a smooth and easy-to-use experience for both customers and administrators.
- **Order synchronization**: Ensuring that orders are correctly synchronized between the mobile application and the control panel.

## Conclusion

**App Delivery Restaurant** is a comprehensive solution that enhances the efficiency and communication between restaurants and their customers. The application allows customers to place orders easily and receive real-time notifications about their order status, while the control panel provides administrators with the necessary tools to manage the restaurant effectively. This project demonstrates the ability to integrate multiple technologies to create a complete and efficient platform that meets the needs of both customers and administrators.
