## Project Description

**Access Control System** is a comprehensive project that includes a **Control Panel** and a **mobile application**. The Control Panel, developed with **Laravel** and **Vue.js**, allows operators and administrators to generate detailed reports on entries and exits to the establishment, as well as manage information about the users attending the site. This system was created in response to the pandemic restrictions, where it was necessary to control the number of people who could access the premises simultaneously.

The mobile application, developed with **Ionic**, **Cordova**, and **Angular**, enables the establishment's guards to scan attendees' documents to record their entries and exits. Additionally, end users (attendees of the establishment) use the application to register and manage their access.

## Functionality

### Control Panel

Administrators and operators of the establishment can:

- **Create, edit, and delete attendees**
- **View and generate reports** on entries and exits
- **Generate detailed reports** on attendees
- **View a dynamic map** with the list of attendees
- **View the vehicle reservation calendar**

### Mobile Application

Guards of the establishment can:

- **Scan documents or QR codes** of attendees to record entries and exits
- **Reserve shifts** and **register vehicles**

Attendees can:

- **Register** to access the establishment
- **Generate QR codes** to enter and exit
- **Reserve shifts** to access and exit the establishment
- **Reserve parking spaces** for vehicles

## Challenges

The main challenge of the project was to develop a functional MVP in a very limited time frame so the establishment could operate during the pandemic. Among the most challenging components was the **interactive map**, implemented with **Leaflet**. Due to the large number of users, a marker clustering system was used to group them and improve visualization.

Additionally, the mobile application needed to be installed on numerous devices and required the capability to scan QR codes and PDF417 codes present on the National Identity Documents of Argentina.
