## Project Description

**Bingo App** is a project comprising a **static website** and a **control panel** developed with **Vue.js** and **Laravel**. The website showcases previous draws, including their recordings and winners. It also features live streaming and displays the accumulated jackpot amount.

There are two control panels: one for users and another for administrators. The user panel allows purchasing credits, buying bingo cards, requesting payments to bank accounts, playing interactively online, among other functions. The system administrator's panel enables the management of new draws, adjusting parameters, and recording results. Additionally, the project includes an automated mailing system to notify the winners of the draws.

## Functionality

Administrators and business operators, through the control panel, can:

- Create, edit, and delete draws
- Create, edit, and delete users
- Manage payments
- Record winners
- Sell credits and bingo cards
- Generate reports

End customers, through the web app, can:

- View their transactions
- View and participate in draws
- Purchase credits
- Buy bingo cards
- Play interactively online

## Challenges

This project emerged during the pandemic and was essential for the Bingo to continue operating despite the restrictions. One of the main challenges was coordinating the draws broadcast via streaming with the online interactive game section. Additionally, implementing an efficient mailing system and ensuring the scalability of the system to support a large number of users simultaneously was necessary.

## Conclusion

**Bingo App** is a comprehensive solution that allows users to participate in bingo draws interactively and securely. The application combines functionality, efficiency, and an excellent user experience, ensuring the continuity of Bingo even during restrictive times. This project highlights adaptability and innovation in web and mobile application development.
