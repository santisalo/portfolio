## Project Description

**Tienda Wpp** is a web application consisting of a **private Control Panel** and some public routes for end users. It is developed with **Vue.js** and **Laravel**. For the visual part, the **Vuetify** framework was used.

This application is designed to facilitate its use without the need to download a specific application. End users can access the catalog simply by scanning a QR code. Additionally, it is intended for use both in the **physical store** and for **online orders via WhatsApp**. The control panel allows configuring all these functionalities.

**Within the control panel, the available features include:**

- **Creation, editing, and deletion of products**
- **Creation, editing, and deletion of categories**
- **Configuration of business data**, including social media and WhatsApp number for orders
- **Configuration of color schemes** to maintain the business's style

**In the public part of the application, end users can:**

- **View business information** in the header
- **View business products** grouped by category
- **Search for products**
- **Create an order** with various products, quantities, variants, and extras
- **Generate a WhatsApp message** with the order and customer information

## Challenges

During the development of the project, several challenges arose in terms of architecture, design, and implementation, such as:

- Managing multiple businesses under a single web application
- Customizing each store to meet each client/business's needs
- Creating a user-friendly interface for end users
