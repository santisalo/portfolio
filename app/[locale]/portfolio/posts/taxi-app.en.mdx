## Project Description

**Taxi App** is a mobile application designed for taxi or rideshare companies. It consists of a mobile app for Android (used by drivers) and a Control Panel (used by an operator of the taxi company). 

The mobile application is developed with **Ionic**, **Angular**, and **Cordova**. This choice was made to leverage various mobile features such as background geolocation and push notifications. 

On the other hand, the control panel has its backend built with **Laravel** and its frontend developed with **Vue.js** and **Vuetify**. In the control panel, operators can create trips for drivers to accept via the mobile app. While the application is currently deployed for Android, it also has the potential to be deployed for iOS.

## Features

Through the control panel, taxi company administrators can:

- **Create, edit, and delete drivers**
- **Create, edit, and delete vehicles**
- **Manage vehicle payments**
- **Configure pricing**
- **Generate reports**

Operators can:

- **Create trips** with origin and destination details, customer information, observations, etc.
- **Assign specific drivers** to trips
- **View all vehicles in real-time** with their respective statuses (Available, Absent, Not Available)
- **Generate reports**

Additionally, drivers using the mobile app can:

- **Receive trip requests** based on their geographic location
- **Change their current status**
- **Update their personal information**
- **Review their trip history**

The entire structure is designed to add a new application for end-users in the future, allowing them to request trips directly from the app.

## Challenges

One of the significant challenges of this project was efficiently utilizing Google Cloud's Realtime Database alongside the device's Geolocation API. By integrating these technologies with **Leaflet** and **OpenStreetMap** in the control panel, we can track the real-time location of all drivers. This feature enables us to assign trips to the nearest driver and allows the agency to manually assign trips more efficiently.

Another challenge was the automatic fare calculation for a trip based on its distance, due to the complexity of the pricing structure.

The application also uses **Google Maps APIs** to display maps and handle directions.

**Taxi App** is an innovative and efficient solution for managing taxi companies, integrating cutting-edge technologies to enhance operational efficiency and real-time control. The ability to efficiently assign trips, manage resources, and offer an improved experience for both drivers and passengers demonstrates the system's versatility and effectiveness. This project highlights my ability to develop comprehensive and functional applications that can solve complex problems and adapt to the needs of the end user.
