## Project Description

**Painting Website** is a project that consists of a **Website** I developed for a new line of paints being introduced by a specific paint store. This website was created using **WordPress** and **Elementor**.

It is a simple website that showcases the new products and their benefits. Additionally, it includes basic functionalities such as a contact form. The highlights of this project are the effective use of Elementor, the attractive design, and the use of animations on the main page.

You can access the website here: [Toulouse Pinturas](http://toulousepinturas.com.ar/).
