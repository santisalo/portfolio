## Project Description

**Sales Representative App** is a project that consists of a **Control Panel** for administrators and a **Mobile App** for sales representatives. Through the mobile application, sales representatives can place orders, which administrators prepare for pick-up. Administrators receive notifications of new orders in their control panel, allowing them to manage orders efficiently.

## Functionality

Administrators and business operators, through the control panel, can:

- **Create, edit, and delete sales representatives**
- **Create, edit, and delete categories**
- **Create, edit, and delete products**
- **Create, edit, and delete offers**
- **Configure service hours**
- **Manage orders**, including updating their statuses
- **Generate reports**

On the other hand, sales representatives, through the mobile application, can:

- **Create and place orders**
- **Receive notifications** about order status changes
- **View available offers**

## Challenges

This project is an adaptation of a previously developed project. Certain functionalities, especially the payment section, were modified to meet the needs of sales representatives. Push notifications are a key feature in this case, as they notify sales representatives when their order is ready for pick-up.

## Conclusion

**Sales Representative App** is an efficient solution that improves communication and order management between sales representatives and administrators. The integration of push notifications and real-time order management demonstrates the adaptability and functionality of the application, optimizing workflow and enhancing the user experience.
