- **Generate Detailed Reports**: Analyze service performance and statistics.

### Couriers
Using the Mobile App, couriers can:

- **Receive and Manage Orders**: Accept or reject delivery requests.
- **GPS-Assisted Navigation**: Use optimized maps and directions.
- **Automatic Fare Calculation by Distance**: Calculate delivery fees based on distance.
- **Update Order Status**: Mark orders as picked up, in transit, and delivered.

### Customers
Using the Mobile App, customers can:

- **Place Orders**: Request deliveries, errands, and product purchases.
- **Track Orders in Real-Time**: View the location and status of their orders.
- **Order History**: Review and repeat previous orders.
- **Secure Payments**: Make payments through the app using secure methods.

## Challenges

The development of **Courier App** presented several significant challenges:

- **Real-Time Geolocation Integration**: Implementing a precise and efficient system for tracking couriers.
- **Scalability**: Designing an architecture capable of handling a large volume of users and orders simultaneously.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Creating a user-friendly experience for both customers and couriers.
- **Data Security**: Ensuring the protection of users' personal and payment information.

## Conclusion

**Courier App** is a robust and versatile solution for managing delivery and shopping services. The integration of advanced features, such as real-time geolocation and comprehensive order management, along with a user-friendly interface, optimizes workflow and significantly enhances the user experience. This project showcases the ability to integrate multiple technologies to create a complete and efficient platform that meets the needs of customers, couriers, and administrators.
