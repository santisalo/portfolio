## Project Description

**App Validación por GPS** is a project comprising a **Control Panel** for administrators and a **Mobile Application** for end users. It is used by system administrators to validate the geolocation of users when they perform tasks at specific locations and times.

## Functionality

### Control Panel for Administrators
Through the control panel, system administrators can:

- **Manage users**: Create, edit, and delete user accounts.
- **Monitor work orders**: View all work orders on a map.

### Mobile Application for Users
Through the mobile application, users can:

- **Log in**: Sign in with their credentials.
- **Submit work orders**: Create and submit new work orders.
- **Validate geolocation with fingerprint**: Perform geolocation validation using their fingerprint, even offline.
- **Asynchronous data transmission**: Send validation data once an internet connection is available.

## Challenges

The development of **App Validación por GPS** faced several significant challenges:

- **Offline functionality**: Ensuring that the system could store data locally on the phone and synchronize with the database once an internet connection is detected.
- **Biometric security**: Implementing a reliable biometric validation system to ensure user identity when validating tasks. The application needed to detect when users added new fingerprints to their devices and prompt them to re-register within the app to prevent unauthorized validations.

## Conclusion

**App Validación por GPS** is a robust and versatile solution for geolocation validation in task management. The application enhances efficiency and security by allowing users to validate their presence at specific locations and times using biometric data, even offline. Administrators benefit from a comprehensive control panel to manage users and monitor work orders effectively. This project demonstrates the ability to integrate advanced technologies to create a reliable and secure platform that meets the needs of both administrators and end users.
