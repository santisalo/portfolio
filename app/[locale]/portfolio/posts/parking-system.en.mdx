## Project Description

The **Parking System** is a web application designed to efficiently manage a parking business. This system handles vehicle check-ins and check-outs, manages monthly and weekly stays, records customized financial transactions, and generates detailed reports. Additionally, it includes functionalities for fiscal printer billing and electronic invoicing.

The system is designed to be multi-user, facilitating management for both operators, who handle vehicle check-ins and check-outs, and administrators, who manage reports and long-term stays.

## Functionality

### Operators
Operators can:

- **Register vehicle check-ins and check-outs** quickly and efficiently.
- **Issue customized tickets** using fiscal printers.
- **Manage temporary vehicle stays**.

### Administrators
Administrators have access to:

- **User management**: Create, edit, and delete operator accounts.
- **Reports and statistics**: Generate detailed reports on daily, monthly, and annual operations.
- **Billing**: Issue electronic invoices through the AFIP API and manage billing through fiscal printers.
- **Rate configuration**: Set and adjust rates for different types of stays.

## Challenges

### Integration with Fiscal Printers
One of the main challenges was integrating the system with fiscal printers for issuing customized tickets, which required specific technical development to ensure compatibility and efficient functionality.

### Implementation of the AFIP API
Implementing the AFIP API for electronic invoicing presented significant technical challenges, ensuring compliance with local regulations and smooth integration with the business's billing system.

### Designing an Agile UI
Developing a user interface (UI) that allowed rapid and efficient use of the system was crucial, especially to handle peak hours when vehicles enter and exit frequently. This required a focus on usability and minimizing the time needed to register each operation.

## Conclusion

The **Parking System** has proven to be a robust and versatile solution for managing parking businesses, facilitating both daily operations and long-term administration. The combination of advanced functions and an intuitive user interface optimizes workflow and enhances the user experience for both operators and administrators.
